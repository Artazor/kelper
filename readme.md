#![Kelper](http://git.ctco.lv/raw/~alexander.domotenko/training/builder.git/master/resources/icon.png) Kelper 0.1.1

Kelper is a tool that is based on Grunt and is used for simplifying the process of building projects from source. It is used to compile project with automatical checks for Unit test and UI test mistakes in webpages that are using by project.

##Features

* Be awesome
* Automatically download dependencies
* Autocompile, optimize and finalize project
* Make required tests

##Support

If you are having issues or ideas, please let me know throught email **[pavel.kotov@ctco.lv](mailto://pavel.kotov@ctco.lv)** or add this issue as comment to **[Confluence](https://confluence.ctco.lv/confluence/display/UICM/Training)**.

Source code: http://git.ctco.lv/tree/?r=~alexander.domotenko/training/builder.git

##Installation

This plugin requires Grunt `0.4.5 or newer`.

If you haven't used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a Gruntfile as well as install and use Grunt plugins. 

Kelper can be installed with these methods:

```
npm install git+https://git.ctco.lv/r/~alexander.domotenko/training/builder.git --save
```

or add as dependency to package.json file.

```
"dependencies": {
    "kelper": "git+https://git.ctco.lv/r/~alexander.domotenko/training/builder.git",
    "grunt": "^0.4.5"
}
```

Once the plugin has been installed, your Gruntfile should look like this:

```
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('kelper');
};
```

##Configuration

To make plugin working you should create config folder in root of project directory.

There should be these folders:

* **build** (optional)
* **target**

### Build configuration
-----------------------

There can be 3 files that is used to setup builder configuration on each process that should be written as grunt export plugin. There files should contain Javascript and return JSON with pre-defined values. These values are parsed and used in builder.
If there is no files or configuration is not rewrited then default configuration will be taken.

Processes:

* **Compile** (compile.js) - Used to compile typescript
* **Optimization** (optimization.js) - Used to run RequireJS
* **Finalization** (finalization.js) - Used to minify, copy and hash files

By default all 3 tasks will be runned. There are 2 types, how this parameter can be changed:

 1. with additional parameter **-process** or **-p**;
 2. Use task **"kelper"** with process name ( *Only full process name is available* )

There are available these commands:

* **"c"** or **"compile"** - only compile process will be run
* **"o"** or **"optimization"** - will run compile and optimization task
* **"f"** or **"finalization"** - will run all 3 tasks

*Example of usage:*

```
grunt -process optimization
```
or

```
grunt kelper:optimization
```

#### Compile
------------

Compile process is used to compile TypeScript.
There are 3 main parameters:

* **source** - path of folder from base directory that should be compiled
* **target** - path of folder from base directory that collects compiled files
* **version** - compiled javascript standart
* **baseConfig** - is callback function that is used for each package, returned information will be merged or overwritten by environment config.

##### baseConfig
------------

This function is used as callback function for each package. Returned information will be merged or overwritten by environment config.

*Usage*:

* Firstly, will be taken default configuration and overwritten with baseConfig returned data.
* Secondly, will be taken Environment data and merged using smart merge function (object will be extended, arrays merged and all otherwise will be overwritten)

*Example*:

```
module.exports = function(grunt){
    return {
        source: 'src',
        target: 'target/compiled',
        version: 'es5',
        baseConfig: function(pkg){
	        case "common/main":
                    return {
                        "libraryMetadata": [
                            grunt.file.readJSON(path.resolve(package.sourcePath, 'module.json'))
                        ]
                    };
                default:
                    return null;
        }
    };
};
```

#### Optimization
-----------------

Optimization process is used to optimize RequireJS, generate libraries and compile them
There are 3 main parameters:

* **remoteBaseUrl** - xxxxxxxxxxx
* **source** - path of folder from base directory that should be optimized
* **target** - path of folder from base directory that collects optimized files

*Optimization file example*:

```
module.exports = function(grunt){
    return {
        remoteBaseUrl: 'src',
        source: 'target/compiled',
        target: 'target/optimized'
    };
};
```

#### Finalization
-----------------

Finalization process is used to minify, copying static resources and hash files.
There are 3 main parameters:

* **resourcePath** - resource folder path from base directory
* **source** - path of folder from base directory that should be finalized
* **target** - path of folder from base directory that collects finalized files

*Finalization file example*:

```
module.exports = function(grunt){
    return {
        resourcePath: 'resources',
        source: 'target/optimized',
        target: 'target/finalized'
    };
};
```


### Environment (Target) configuration
--------------------------------------

Environment configuration is used for builder to get project build information. All information should be in **JSON** format. Default file is **"local.json"**, but if you need use another one, Kelper should be runned with additional parameter **"-target"** or **"-t"**.

*Example:*

```
grunt -target dev
```

Environment configuration should contain **JSON** format data and all data is optional.

By adding additional configuration Kelper will make additional functions like minifying, building libraries and packages, copying resources.

There can be these configuration parameters:

* **uglify** - is used in finalization process to minify files
* **base** - is used in optimization and finalization process to define static libraries like jQuery, Backbone and others.
* **libraries** - is used in optimization and finalization process to define libraries that should be exported.
* **packages** - is used in optimization and finalization process to define RequireJS static packages.
* **hash** - is used in finalization process to define hash method.
* **resources** -  is used in finalization process to define static resources for copy process.

#### Uglify configuration parameter
-----------------------------------

Without this parameter finalization process will continue it's work without minification process. This is standart Uglify configuration that will be copied to it's process.

For more information [follow this link](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify).

*Example of configuration:*

```
{
    "uglify": {
        "mangle": false,
        "compress": false,
        "beautify": true,
        "preserveComments": "some"
    }
}
```

#### Base configuration parameter
---------------------------------

Base is used in optimization and finalization process to define static libraries like jQuery, Backbone and others.
RequireJS is not needed here, it will be automatically downloaded and loaded as library.

*Example of usage:*

```
{
    "base": {
        "jquery": "lib/jquery/jquery"
    }
}
```

#### Libraries configuration parameter
--------------------------------------

Libraries is used in optimization and finalization process to define libraries that should be exported.
This function automatically generates library files and compile them. All configurations that are set in packages are copied to configuration (bootstrap.js or app.nocache.js) files for usage.

Each library has 3 parameters - **"name"** *(string)*, **"include"** *(array of packages)* and **"exclude"** *(array of strings)*, other parameters will be ignored. Library will be automatically generated from inner packages if they exist otherwise library will be ignored.
Each packages has it's own configuration. For more information, look at next paragraph (Packages configuration parameter).

*Example of usage:*

```
{
    "libraries": [
        {
            "name": "sample",
            "packages": [
                {
                    "name": "common"
                },
                {
                    "name": "application",
                    "config": {
                        "title": "My Application"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Packages configuration parameter
-------------------------------------

Packages is used in optimization and finalization process to define RequireJS static packages.

Packages can be used in libraries and separate configuration. Packages configuration looks as array of objects.

Each package contain 1 mandatory field **"name"** *(string)* and 3 optional fields:

* **"config"** *(object)* - is used to setup requireJS configuration
* **"replace"** *(object)* - is used to replace one module with another in production (For UI tests this replacements will be ignored)
* **"dependencies"** *(object)* - is used to add dependencies with ***glob*** functions. There are include and exclude functions available.

Configuration of package will be transferred like in libraries to bootstrap.js file into compile/optimization process and app.nocache.js file into finalization process.

*Example of usage:*

```
{
    "packages": [
        {
            "name": "application1",
            "config": {
                "title": "My package"
            },
            "replace": {
              "common/Component": "common/ComponentProd"
            },
            "dependencies": [
              "**/*.js",
              "!**/*Test.js",
              "!**/*Prod.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


#### HASH configuration parameter
---------------------------------

Hash parameter is used in finalization process to define hash method. After all finalization process this function renames all files by it's content to it's HASH.

Default method is **"MD5"**.

To view all available methods:

- Open console (CMD or Terminal)
- Start Node.JS
- Write "Crypto.getHashes();"

#### Resources configuration parameter
--------------------------------------

Resource parameter is used in finalization process to define static resources for copy process. These parameter should contain array with name of folders that should be copied to finalization folder.

If parameter is not exist or is empty, finalization process continue it's work without copying these files.

*Example of usage:*

```
{
    "resources": [
        "main",
        "prod"
    ]
}
```

##Usage

If project is correctly configured, just launch project using `grunt`.

###Tests
-------------

Every test file should contain bootstrap script and __runTest function that is automatically extended to file. Test bootstrap file will be generated to ***compiled*** folder.
When adding bootstrap file, there should be added additional parameter ***test*** with value ***"ui"*** or ***unit*** depends on test file.

*Example of adding script:*

```
<script src="../../target/compiled/bootstrap.js" test="ui"></script>
```

### Unit tests
--------------

To use automatic Unit tests should be added `*unit.html` file directly into enabled package source folder that should be tested.

All unit tests will be run after compile process.

###UI tests
-----------

To use automatic UI tests should be added HTML file that ends with `*.test.html` into enabled package source folder.

All UI tests will be run after finalize process.
